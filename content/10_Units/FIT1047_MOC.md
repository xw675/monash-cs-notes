## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
After Week 1 you should be able to: explain why computers are digital, stored-program machines built from CPU/RAM/I/O and why all data reduces to bits (bytes, words); convert numbers between decimal, binary and hexadecimal in every direction and add binary numbers by hand; represent signed integers in sign-and-magnitude, 1's and 2's complement, negate via flip-and-add-one, state the 2's-complement range and detect overflow from sign patterns; explain binary scientific notation ($s \times 2^e$), normalise a value into significand + exponent, and reason about floating-point rounding error (why $0.1$ is inexact and why money needs integers); encode/decode text via ASCII (hex ↔ characters) and explain Unicode codepoints, UTF-8's 1–4-byte ASCII-compatible scheme vs UTF-16; and trace the hardware story from electronic switch → vacuum tube → transistor → gate (NOT/OR/AND truth behaviour) → integrated circuit, including Moore's law.

After Week 2 you should be able to: evaluate Boolean expressions and build truth tables (operator precedence NOT > AND > OR, circuit notation $XY$, $X{+}Y$, $\overline{X}$); state and apply the Boolean algebra laws (identity, null, idempotent, inverse, absorption, commutative, associative, distributive, De Morgan) to prove equivalence and simplify expressions, explaining why simplification matters for hardware cost; extract a sum-of-products expression from any truth table and convert it mechanically into a gate circuit; minimise a function with a Karnaugh map — Gray-code layout, maximal power-of-2 rectangular groups with overlap and wrap-around, read-off of the minimal SOP; and explain gate universality — NOT+AND or NOT+OR suffice, and NAND (or NOR) alone is functionally complete.

After Week 7 you should be able to: explain how NICs implement the bottom two layers; distinguish digital encodings (unipolar, NRZ, NRZI, Manchester's self-clocking mid-bit transition) from analog modulation (frequency/amplitude/phase shift keying, and why combining AM+PM multiplies the data rate); describe Ethernet's evolution and recite CSMA/CD's carrier-sense, multiple-access and collision-detection (jam + random backoff) parts, including hub topology and shared-Ethernet's problems; state the address used at each layer (URL, port, IP, MAC) with the client-random/server-fixed port convention; do IPv4 subnet arithmetic with masks (/26) and explain IPv6's 128-bit hierarchical allocation; trace both resolutions — DNS's hierarchical name→IP lookup (iterative vs recursive with ISP caching) and ARP's broadcast IP→MAC discovery; explain per-hop routing-table forwarding with default gateways, static vs dynamic routing, and distance-vector (RIP, ≤15 hops) vs link-state (OSPF) algorithms; and detail TCP's connection lifecycle — sequence/acknowledgement byte counting, ARQ retransmission, 3-way open and full-duplex-forced 4-way close — against UDP's compact connectionless trade-off.

After Week 8 you should be able to: explain how a switch learns its forwarding table from sender MACs, floods unknowns, buffers with store-and-forward, and thereby delivers full-duplex collision-free Ethernet; contrast switches with hubs and routers; apply LAN design levers (standard upgrades, segmentation) to bottlenecks; explain WiFi's 802.11 family, 2.4 vs 5 GHz channels (only 1/6/11 orthogonal at 2.4 GHz), CSMA/CA with the hidden-node rationale and stop-and-wait ARQ, BSS/ESS topologies with roaming, attenuation-aware AP planning, and why servers never belong on WiFi; rank WiFi security modes (open — including captive portals, WEP's crackable static key, WPA2's per-packet AES keys in PSK vs Enterprise 802.1X modes); and describe organisational networking at every scale — owned LANs and fibre backbones in access/distribution/core layers, and the leased WAN triangle of dedicated circuits (guaranteed), carrier packet-switched services (shared) and encrypted VPN tunnels over the Internet (cheap, no guarantees).

After Week 9 you should be able to: describe the Internet as a **network of networks** of **Autonomous Systems** interconnected by **border routers** running **BGP**, distinguishing interior routing (RIP/OSPF/EIGRP, admin's choice) from exterior (BGP only), and explain **IXPs**, **peering vs transit**, the Tier 1/2/3 hierarchy, RIR/APNIC ASN allocation, and why no single body governs the Internet (ISOC/IETF, ICANN, ITU…); explain how an end user joins the Internet (ISP authenticates → assigns IP → supplies router/DNS) and compare access technologies — dial-up (modulate/demodulate, 54 kbit/s), **ADSL** (asymmetric, full-copper-bandwidth 4 kHz sub-bands, filter at home vs **DSLAM** at exchange, VDSL/FTTN), **NBN** (GPON fibre backbone, FTTP/FTTN/curb/fixed-wireless/satellite, RSP/wholesale/PoI) and **4G/5G** (cells, frequency↔range trade-off, latency/IoT aims); explain why huge services stay fast despite HTTP/TCP-IP/BGP not scaling — **load balancing** (DNS multi-IP, hardware LB), **content caching** (transparent cache engine, cacheable GET + `Expires`), and **CDNs** (points of presence near users, peering free at IXPs); describe the **IoT** (device-to-device, enabling cheap chips + IPv6 + low-power wireless) and its security weakness (default credentials → the **Mirai/Dyn** DDoS); and discuss the societal questions — **net neutrality** (equal treatment vs legitimate exceptions like spam/attack blocking and emergency prioritisation), apps vs open standards, platform vs **public utility / natural monopoly** regulation, and the difficulty of online law enforcement.

After Week 10 you should be able to: frame information security by its **goals** — confidentiality, integrity, authenticity, non-repudiation — and match each to the right primitive (encryption ⇒ confidentiality; keyed **MAC**/hash ⇒ integrity; signature + certificate ⇒ authenticity; public-key signature ⇒ non-repudiation), listing crypto/firewalls/MFA as the countermeasure toolkit; explain **symmetric cryptography** (a shared key, substitution **S-boxes** + **permutations** repeated over rounds → **AES/Rijndael**, block chaining with an IV and **CBC-MAC** as used by WPA2) and its three structural weaknesses — key distribution, $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}=O(n^2)$ key scaling, and no non-repudiation; explain **public-key (asymmetric) cryptography** — a key pair from a hard problem, used for encryption (encrypt with the public key), **digital signatures** (sign with the private key) and key establishment, the **RSA** operations $\text{cipher}=m^{e}\bmod n$ / $m=\text{cipher}^{d}\bmod n$ and its key generation ($p,q,n,\Phi(n),e,d$), and current key-length guidance (AES 128/256, RSA 2048/3072); state the properties of **cryptographic hash functions** (one-way, avalanche, collision-resistant), rank MD5/SHA-1/SHA-256, and explain why a bare hash cannot protect integrity in transit whereas a **keyed MAC** can; walk through **Diffie–Hellman key exchange** (public $g,n$, private $a,b$, shared $g^{ab}\bmod n$; the $g{=}5,n{=}47\to15$ example) and justify its security via the **discrete logarithm**, while recognising its lack of authentication; explain how **certificates** close that gap — a **certification authority** signs a public key with identity information, the certificate's contents (owner/validity/subject/issuer), revocation via **CRL** and **OCSP/OCSP stapling**, and the caveat that a certificate proves identity, not that a server is safe; and describe the two applied secure-channel protocols — **TLS** (a security layer between TCP and the application giving HTTPS, its handshake/record/alert sub-protocols, SSL→**TLS 1.3**, DH-established symmetric key, usually server-only authentication) and **VPNs** (an encrypted tunnel that logically relocates a device into a remote network via IPSec/OpenVPN/WireGuard, secure **only between tunnel endpoints**).

After Week 12 you should be able to: classify the common **attack and malware types** — **phishing** (fake login + lure), **ransomware** (encrypt-for-BitCoin; restore from backup, don't pay), **social engineering**, **botnets** (bots → command-and-control → **DDoS**), **denial of service**, and the **virus vs worm vs trojan** distinction (host-attached vs standalone-self-propagating vs hidden-in-legit-software), while debunking "only careless people get malware" (malvertising spreads with no interaction) and the false comfort of anti-virus (known-malware only, a prime target, blind to new malware); explain the four classic **software vulnerabilities** — **buffer overflow** (overwrite the return address; canary/ASLR defences), **command injection** (`;rm -rf /` executed with the host's privileges), **cross-site scripting** (attacker script runs with the trusted domain's rights; stored XSS steals session tokens), and **SQL injection** ("Bobby Tables") — and identify their shared root cause (**unchecked input + excessive privilege**) and defences (sanitisation, parameterised queries/output encoding, least privilege), noting CWE/OWASP as references; recount real **case studies** — the **F5 BIG-IP** management-plane RCE, **Stuxnet** jumping an air gap via USB to destroy centrifuges, the 2008 **Turkey pipeline** ("the main weapon was a keyboard"), and the **Bangladesh Bank** SWIFT theft — drawing the lesson that **exposure plus insecure defaults** is the core risk and patching doesn't clean an already-compromised device; frame **cybersecurity risk management** as accepting that perfect security is impossible and instead managing **residual risk** with the right controls (**NIST RMF** families spanning technical, physical and human domains; the **NICE** framework's 52 professional roles); and discuss **privacy** in the big-data age — cross-linked profiling, "**you are the product**", **privacy-enhancing technologies** (group/ring signatures) that exist but are underused, cookie pop-ups built for **compliance not traceability**, practical self-defence (cookie/script controls, Signal, awareness), and how **data minimisation** improves **both** privacy and cybersecurity (smaller attack surface, less data to misuse).

After Week 11 you should be able to: authenticate a **user** to a system — the three factor types (**something you know / have / are**), why passwords still dominate yet fail (reuse, weak choices, phishing/malware, bad storage, weak resets), and how to store credentials safely (**never cleartext**; a plain hash is beaten by **rainbow tables**; use a **per-user salted hash**), noting login is checked in the OS **kernel mode**; strengthen authentication with **multi-factor authentication** by combining factor types, weighing **biometrics** (usable but not secret, unrevocable, spoofable), **hardware tokens** (secure but costly/recoverable), and **authenticator apps** (weak if on the same device), plus **transaction authentication** (TANs, SMS-TAN and its **SIM-swap** weakness, barcode TAN generators); explain **access control** as deciding who may do what to which resources once authenticated, why **ACLs don't scale** ($1000$ staff × $200$ apps ≈ 2 million entries), how **ticket/token systems** (**Kerberos**, **Active Directory**) and **single sign-on** make it manageable at the cost of a single point of failure, and how access control is circumvented (software flaws, physical attacks, race conditions, USB, social engineering) and hardened (encryption, backups, updates, reduced complexity, Trusted Computing); describe **firewalls** as barriers that **filter (not block)** traffic between a more-secure inside and less-secure outside, how **packet filtering** works (source/destination IP, protocol, ports, connection state if stateful; inside→out usually allowed, outside→in blocked unless permitted) and its limits (stateless, no application context, blind to encrypted tunnels, useless against internal attackers); and explain **IDS vs IPS** (detect/alert/log vs actively block), **signature vs anomaly** detection (fast/known vs slower/novel), and **next-generation firewalls** (application-aware but whose TLS proxying **breaks end-to-end security** and becomes a single point of attack).
