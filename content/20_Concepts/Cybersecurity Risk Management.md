# [[Cybersecurity Risk Management]]

**Context:** [[Information Security and Cryptography]] · the organising philosophy of the whole security half — since **perfect security is impossible**, **manage risk** · the profession behind it

> [!abstract] Quick Revision
> - **🎯 Objective:** **perfect cybersecurity is not achievable** ➔ instead **manage risk** by putting the **right security controls** in place across many domains.
> - **⚡ Critical Bottleneck:** there is a **wide range** of control families — no single control suffices; frameworks (**NIST RMF**) exist precisely because coverage must be systematic, not ad hoc.

## 📝 Managing risk
- **Core premise** ➔ you cannot eliminate risk, only **reduce it to an acceptable level** with appropriate controls (accept the **residual risk**).
- **Control families (NIST RMF)** ➔ 16 families in three groups:
	- **Technical** ➔ Access Control · Identification & Authentication · System & Communications Protection · System & Information Integrity · Accountability & Audit.
	- **Operational / people** ➔ Awareness & Training · Personnel Security · Physical & Environmental Protection · Media Protection · Configuration Management · Contingency Planning · Incident Response.
	- **Management** ➔ Risk Assessment · Security Planning · Certification/Accreditation & Security Assessments · System & Services Acquisition.
- **Framework** ➔ the **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** structures how controls are selected, implemented, assessed, and monitored.

## 👥 Roles in cybersecurity
- **Many job types** ➔ the breadth of controls implies many professional roles.
- **NICE framework** ➔ the U.S. **NIST National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education** identifies **52 distinct roles** — from analyst to architect to incident responder.

## ⚠️ Pitfalls
- 💡 **"Secure" is never binary** ➔ the goal is **acceptable residual risk**, not perfection; claiming a system is "100% secure" misunderstands the discipline.
- 💡 **Controls are cross-cutting** ➔ technical controls ([[Access Control]], [[Firewalls and Packet Filtering|firewalls]], crypto) sit alongside **people/process** controls (training, personnel security, incident response) — security is not only technology.

## 🧠 Active Recall
> [!FAQ]- If perfect security is unachievable, what is the actual goal of a security programme?
> > [!SUCCESS]- Answer
> > - **Direct Criterion:** to **manage risk** — select and operate the **right mix of controls** so that remaining (**residual**) risk is reduced to a level the organisation can **accept**, across technical, physical, and human domains.
> > - **Technical Justification:** **Systematic coverage** ➔ frameworks like the **NIST RMF** ensure controls (from access control to incident response to training) are chosen and monitored deliberately, rather than leaving gaps an attacker exploits.
