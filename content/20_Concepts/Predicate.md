# [[Predicate]]

**Context:** [[FIT1058_MOC]] · a [[Binary Relation|relation]] used in a logical context · a truth-valued function of its arguments · combined by [[Logical Connectives]] and bound by [[Quantifiers (Existential and Universal)|quantifiers]]

> [!abstract] Quick Revision
> - **🎯 Objective:** a truth-valued function of its arguments ➔ extends propositional logic to assertions *about objects*.
> - **📦 Core Components:** arity ➔ unary (property) / binary (infix $<$) / higher ➔ yields a proposition once arguments fixed.
> - **⚡ Critical Bottleneck:** binds variables via [[Quantifiers (Existential and Universal)|quantifiers]]; only $=$ is available by default.

## 📝 Core
### 1. The Predicate (Relation as Truth-Function)
- **Definition** ➔ a [[Binary Relation|relation]] viewed as a **truth-valued function** of its arguments ➔ the basis of predicate (first-order) logic.
- **Power** ➔ one statement with a **variable** stands for infinitely many specific assertions.
- **Just a relation** ➔ calling it "predicate" adds no maths ➔ flags intent to *make and combine logical statements*.

### 2. Arity & Composition
- **Unary** ➔ $\text{isNegative}(x)$ (also a **property**); **binary** ➔ $x<y$ (infix); **higher** ➔ $\text{knows}(x,y,t)$.
- **Evaluation** ➔ applied to specific arguments ⟹ a truth value ($\text{Parent}(\text{Ada},\text{Byron})=$T).
- **Combine** ➔ once arguments fixed, each application is a [[Proposition and Truth Value|proposition]] ➔ all [[Logical Connectives]] apply.

### 3. Equality Is Free
- **Built-in** ➔ $=$ usable over **any** domain without declaration.
- **Why** ➔ you cannot reason about a class without telling when two objects are the same ➔ the *only* default predicate.

**Key identities:**

$$\text{Parent}(\text{Ada},\text{Byron})=\text{True},\qquad \text{Parent}(\text{Boole},\text{Everest})=\text{False}$$
$$\text{Parent}(\text{Plato},\text{Ariston})\wedge\text{Parent}(\text{Hypatia},\text{Theon}) \quad (\text{combine with connectives})$$

## ⚖️ Core Decision Matrix
| Arity | Form | Name | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $P(x)$ | property | $\text{Even}(x)$ |
| 2 | $x<y$ / $R(x,y)$ | binary relation | $\text{Parent}(x,y)$ |
| $n$ | $R(x_1,\dots,x_n)$ | [[n-ary Relation]] | $\text{knows}(x,y,t)$ |

> [!NOTE] **Crossover Invariant:** predicates beat plain propositions because a variable-carrying statement generalises over a whole domain; a fixed proposition is just a predicate with all arguments bound. Equality is the sole assumed predicate; all others need declared arity + domains.

## 📊 Exam Execution Trace

### Manual Execution Trace
Domain $\{2,3,4\}$, predicates $\text{Even}(x)$, $\text{Lt}(x,y)\equiv x<y$:

| Step / State | Expression | Evaluation | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0 (Init)** | — | — | — |
| 1 | $\text{Even}(4)$ | $4$ even | T |
| 2 | $\text{Lt}(2,3)$ | $2<3$ | T |
| 3 | $\neg\text{Even}(3)\wedge\text{Lt}(3,4)$ | $\text{T}\wedge\text{T}$ | T |

## ⚠️ Pitfalls
- 💡 **Arguments must fit the domains** ➔ a predicate's arguments are [[Term, Variable, and Constant|terms]] whose types match each slot ($<$ on $\mathbb R$ needs real arguments); a bare predicate with a free variable is *not yet* a proposition until fixed or quantified.

## 🧠 Active Recall
> [!FAQ]- How is a predicate related to a relation, and what does calling it a "predicate" add?
> - **Core Insight Requirement:** Relation as truth-function.
> > [!SUCCESS]- Answer
> > - **Direct Criterion:** A predicate *is* a relation viewed as a truth-valued function; "predicate" signals intent to form logical statements.
> > - **Technical Justification:** **Property = unary** ➔ $\text{Parent}(x,y)$ returns True iff $(x,y)$ is in the relation; connectives and quantifiers then apply.

> [!FAQ]- Why is $=$ always available when no other predicate is assumed?
> - **Core Insight Requirement:** Identity is prerequisite to reasoning.
> > [!SUCCESS]- Answer
> > - **Direct Criterion:** You cannot reason about a class without deciding when two objects are the same.
> > - **Technical Justification:** **Sole built-in** ➔ every other predicate must be declared with arity + argument domains.
